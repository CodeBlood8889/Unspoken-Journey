                            Yep, that‚Äôs your father‚Äôs account on X (formerly Twitter) üôà.<br><br>
                            
                            I told you, didn‚Äôt I? I tried searching for you on every social media platform I could!<br><br>
                            
                            At first, I didn‚Äôt realize it was your father‚Äôs account. But after scrolling through a lot of his posts, I found several pictures of him with you.<br>  
                            That‚Äôs when I guessed, ‚ÄúYep, he‚Äôs her dad.‚Äù<br>  
                            It‚Äôs also where I discovered that your native place is Koderma.<br><br>
                            
                            While scrolling through his posts, I even thought for a moment that he might be in a political party  
                            (because of the kind of posts he shared ü´£). But later, you clarified he‚Äôs in the medical field.<br><br>
                            
                            And then, almost at the very end of his profile, I found a video from Raksha Bandhan.<br>  
                            That was the <b>first</b> time I ever heard your voice.  
                            (Your phone call to me was the <b>second</b>‚Äîand yes, I still have that recording üôà.)<br><br>

                            No-no, I haven‚Äôt left your Instagram space yet ü´£‚ÄîI still want to see your memes and reels.  
                            But not sure how long we will be connected, after this project for you<br><br>
                            
                            Anyway, let me get back to the story!<br><br>
                            
                            You know, Natalya, even before I followed your main account, I had already collected around 40-50 of your photos.  
                            (That count has now reached about 250 üôà)<br><br>
                            
                            Can you guess where I found those photos?  
                            I bet you can‚Äôt, because even I was surprised to discover the best place to get to know more about you.<br><br>
                            
                            <b>NILAY</b><br><br>
                            
                            At first, I didn‚Äôt realize he was your brother. I was just browsing through your art page‚Äôs followers, hoping to find someone connected to you.  
                            <br>To my luck, I found two open accounts. One, I can‚Äôt remember exactly who he was, but there was a Holi photo of you standing between him and Nilay.<br><br>
                            
                            That‚Äôs how I landed on Nilay‚Äôs account, which was open at that time.  
                            Through his posts, I saw the beautiful bond you both shared‚Äîyour sibling love really shone through in all those pictures.<br><br>
                            
                            For a few months, I was low-key stalking you through Nilay‚Äôs Instagram.  
                            Every day, I‚Äôd check his stories to see if he posted anything about you.<br><br>
                            
                            I even remember the story he posted when he came to Bangalore to visit you for the first time (mid-April 2023, I think).  
                            You looked so happy to see him (and that "GHAR KA KHANA")! Then you both went to so many places together, including Nandi Hills.<br><br>
                            
                            But then one day, he made his account private üòÇüòÇ (Why did he have to do that, yaar?)<br><br>
                            
                            And so, my hunt for the next account began. (I was too fattu to directly follow your account back then.)<br><br>
                            
                            Guess whose account I ended up on next?

                            After <b>7 months and 4 days</b>.<br><br>
                            
                            That evening, I was casually scrolling through Instagram when, out of nowhere, a LinkedIn message notification popped up. For a second, I couldn‚Äôt believe it‚Äî<b>*you*</b> had messaged me first!<br><br>
                            
                            I don‚Äôt know if you remember this, but your message initially said <b>"(Edited)"</b>. I had already seen your original message, which was just <b>"Hi."</b> üòÑ  
                            Then you edited it! üòÇ I‚Äôm not sure what was going through your mind, but it definitely made me smile.<br><br>
                            
                            The very first thing I did after seeing your message? I turned toward Krishna and quietly thanked him‚Äîfinally, it had happened.<br><br>
                            
                            But you know what I was doing during all those months, between seeing your LinkedIn post and receiving that first message from you?  
                            Now, this is the part I‚Äôve been wanting to tell you for so long.<br><br>
                            
                            After seeing your first LinkedIn post, I just wanted to see you more often. But back then, I was only following your <b>nuts.quills.art</b> page and not your personal account.<br><br>
                            
                            So, what did I do?<br><br>
                            
                            Remember the Fun Fridays at Capgemini? You participated twice‚Äîonce with your quilling art and another time with your dance performance.<br><br>
