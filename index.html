            Hi Natalya,<br><br>
            
            I hope you’re having a great start to the year.<br><br>
            
            I’m not sure if you were expecting this kind of approach from me, but this has been on my mind for quite a few months now.<br>  
            I was confused about how to convey it, and even while creating this project, I was scared about whether it would work in my favor or not.<br><br>
            
            I assume you might have an idea where this conversation is going, but I’m deeply requesting you not to close this project  
            without seeing it through to the end.<br><br>
            
            By now, you might be thinking, “Just like all the other guys, here’s another one confessing because I started sharing reels on Instagram  
            and daily snaps.” But with absolute honesty, I promise you this project is not at all built as a reaction to that.<br><br>
            
            For now, I ask you not to think in that direction—at least not until you’ve seen the entire project.<br><br>
            
            First, let me tell you the real story I’ve been holding back. Then, I’ll leave it up to you to decide what to think.<br><br>
            
            If you’re ready, let’s start. (ALL MY FINGERS CROSSED! JAI SHREE KRISHNA!)<br>
