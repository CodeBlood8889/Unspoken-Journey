            Hey,<br><br>
            First of all, thank you so much for taking the time to go through the entire story. It means a lot to me.<br><br>
            
            Now comes the biggest question: <b>Why am I telling you all this now?</b><br><br>
            
            Natalya, now that you know where it all started—almost two years back—I just want you to see it from my perspective for a moment.<br><br>  
            From the very first day, I started liking you, even though we had never interacted. And even now, I still get excited every time  
            I see a notification on my phone that says, “Message/Snap received from Artist” (yes, that’s how your name is saved in my phone).<br>  
            I still take screenshots of your stories and snaps because, to me, they mean something special.<br><br>

            At first, even I thought it was just a crush, something that would fade away with time. But it didn’t.<br>
            The more I got to know you—even in the smallest ways—the stronger this feeling grew.<br>
            And now, my heart keeps telling me that you’re someone truly special to me.<br>
            It’s not just about how you look or the stories and snaps you share. It’s about everything—your kindness, your vibe, and how you make things feel so special without even trying.<br><br>
            
            I hope you’ll understand that holding onto these feelings without knowing your side is not something I can do forever.<br>
            At some point, we all have to make important decisions about life.  
            That’s why I thought, why not choose the life I truly want, instead of leaving it to chance?<br><br>
            
            That’s the biggest and only reason why I decided to do this. Because if I didn’t, I’d always wonder “what if.”<br>  
            And honestly, it would take me a long time to move on from this.<br>
            That’s why I felt it’s better to hear your thoughts now—it would help me find the clarity I need, no matter what the outcome.<br><br>
            
            Please know, this isn’t about putting any pressure on you. From the start, this has always been about how I feel.  
            I’m not expecting you to feel the same way right now or to match my feelings at this point.<br><br>I just wanted to know your thoughts—after hearing my story, is there even a small chance  
            you’d consider looking forward to this with me?<b>Or maybe there’s already someone else who’s the lucky one.</b> 😊<br><br>
            
            I’m really sorry if this feels sudden. I know I’ve had plenty of time to think about this, whereas for you, it’s all coming at once.  
            But trust me, there’s no rush and no pressure—I just wanted to know where we stand.<br><br>
            
            And please, don’t hesitate to be honest with me. If this project frustrated you, or if you feel like I overstepped  
            without your consent, or even if you feel there’s no place for me in your life, just say it. I will respect your feelings completely.<br><br>  
            I’ll delete everything and step away, giving you the space you deserve. (And no, don’t worry—it’s nothing extreme like  
            suicide or anything. I just mean I’ll quietly move on and let you be.)<br><br>
            
            All I ask is for your transparency. Whatever it is, please tell me. Because I can’t continue being just a normal friend,  
            if you know what I mean.<br><br>

            And hey, no matter what, I’ll always look back at this and smile, knowing that I was brave enough to do this,
            and I hope we can both walk away from it feeling good, no matter the outcome.<br><br>

            Finally, I just wanted to show some beautiful memories that I collected (sometimes through screenshot and sometimes by using camera of other phone)<br><br>

            Check the next one and not sure I will get a chance after this but...Thanks Natalya for crossing my path!!!<br>
